## Chat UI

Implement a chat UI for mobile devices similar to e.g. [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) or [Facebook messenger](https://www.messenger.com/).
Mock the server calls, i.e. implement only the frontend.

You should implement the following views and navigation between them:
### Chat list: 
  - list chats in which you are participant (there can be multiple participants in a chat)
  - clicking an item in the chat list will take you to that chat's details view
  
### Chat details view: 
  - list all messages in the chat. Messages may contain text, emoticons & images.
  - functionality to send a new chat message
  
### Technology constraints & considerations
- Use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- You may use additional libraries, but if you do explain why you did
- Include instructions how to run the app & tests. Include enough mock data for us to test your UI.
- You might want to have look at the available boilerplate projects to get started, e.g. https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
